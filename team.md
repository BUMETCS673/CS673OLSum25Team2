# About Iqra
My name is Iqra. Before moving into tech, I worked in early childhood education, supporting children, families and staff as both a teacher and program coordinator. I gave teachers the support they needed, whether it was solving day-to-day challenges or communicating with parents, leadership and external partners. That experience taught me the value of clear communication, and how to keep teams organized and connected. I still rely on these skills today as I transition into tech.

# About Thomas
Hey, my name is Thomas. I earned my B.S. in Biology with the goal of attending medical school, but the 100+ hours of work every week with endless studying for the next decade was fairly daunting due to my lack of passion for the field so I decided to pivot my career into software development. I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science and I plan to graduate at the end of this semester. In my free time, I work with a small team of 6 developers to build a web app called ShipSentry using TypeScript, React, Node.js, Next.js, Golang, and the Google Cloud Platform. I'm looking forward to working with my team and improving as a developer over the next 6 weeks.
