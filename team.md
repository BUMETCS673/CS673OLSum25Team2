# About Iqra
My name is Iqra. Before moving into tech, I worked in early childhood education, supporting children, families and staff as both a teacher and program coordinator. I gave teachers the support they needed, whether it was solving day-to-day challenges or communicating with parents, leadership and external partners. That experience taught me the value of clear communication, and how to keep teams organized and connected. I still rely on these skills today as I transition into tech.
